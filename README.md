## Charlotte Mannion

I am a full stack developer and graduate of Makers Academy looking for a Junior developer role. I'm excited for the opportunity to continue the steep learning curve that I started at Makers. I'm looking for a position in a supportive team environment with people who share my enthusiasm for clean, clear code.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

Our first team challenge at Makers was to build an Airbnb clone in vanilla javascript. The set up of the project proved to be quite challenging. However, by ensuring my team stuck to daily stand ups, check-ins and retros, I ensured the team remained cohesive, focused on our objectives, and also made the week really fun. When reflecting on this week, I felt that the most important skill I had learned was how to work well in a dev team, and I took this learning with me in to the rest of my time at Makers.
 
#### Fast Learner

In my previous job, I joined a team initially consisting of only two people, on a Project where I was considered an SME for Ringtail E-Discovery software. I had never used this software before and did not have a technical background. But through research and writing how-to guides as I went, I was able to quickly solidify my understanding. This also meant I was soon able to teach other people on the project how to use the software. 

#### Excellent Communicator

In my previous job I was required to explain, or 'demistify' the technology we were using to those in decision making positions that were less technically minded. This helped these stakeholders recognise the value he work my team was doing.  This experience showed me the importance of open and patient communication with others, and I think it will serve me well in my future career as a software developer.
