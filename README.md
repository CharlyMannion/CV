## Charlotte Mannion

I am a full stack developer and graduate of Makers Academy looking for a Junior developer role. I'm excited for the opportunity to continue the steep learning curve that I started at Makers. I'm looking for a position in a supportive team environment with people who share my enthusiasm for clean, clear code.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

AT RBS, I joined a team initially consisting of only two people on a Project where I was considered a Project SME for Ringtail E-Discovery software.  I had never used this software before and did not have a technical background. My diligence and ability to adapt quickly allowed me to make a steep learning curve, and I was soon teaching other people on the project and new team members to use the software.

#### Initiative

After joining RBS, I recognised the need to establish a formalised process for the removal of data from the live environment of the project's Casebook, which I designed and proposed to my workstream lead. This process was subsequently implemented across the Bank Project.

#### People

In my previous role I was required to explain, or 'demistify' the technology we were using  to those in decision making positions that were less technically minded. This was essential to ensure these stakeholders recognised the value in the work my team was doing.  This experience showed me the importance of open and patient communication with others, and of breaking down the barriers to understanding created by technical language.
