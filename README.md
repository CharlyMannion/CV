## Charlotte Mannion

I am a full stack developer and graduate of Makers Academy looking for a Junior developer role. I'm excited for the opportunity to continue the steep learning curve that I experience at Makers in a supportive environment with people who share my enthusiasm for code and teamwork.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

AT RBS, I joined a team initially consisting of only two people on a Project, and where I was considered a Project SME for Ringtail E-Discovery software. Yet I had never used this software before and did not having a technical background. My diligence and ability to adapt quickly allowed me to make a steep learning curve, and I was soon training others.

#### Initiative

In my previous roles and at University, I had a reputation for being motivated and self-disciplined. This skill was first honed whilst studying for my degree, where organisation and the ability to complete work independently was essential, given that I had only 4 hours of contact time with professors each week. This has helped me to take the initiative in the workplace. In my role at RBS, I recognised the need to establish a formalised process for the removal of data from our databases, which I designed and proposed to my workstream lead. This process was subsequently implemented across the Bank Project.

#### People

In my previous role I was required to explain, or 'demistify' the technology we were using  to those in decision making positions that were less technically minded. This was essential to ensure these stakeholders recognised the value in the work my team was doing.  This experience showed me the importance of open and patient communication with others, and of breaking down the barriers to understanding created by technical language.
