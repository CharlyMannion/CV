## Charlotte Mannion

I am a full stack Ruby developer and student at Makers Academy.

After graduating from the University of Edinburgh with a First Class History degree, I made a (relatively) brief foray in to the world of Finance. But it soon dawned on me that I needed to pursue a career that I was genuinely interested in and that would bring new intellectual challenges. Coding has certainly proved challenging (and fascinating) so far!

I'm looking for a Junior developer role in with plenty of learning opportunities and fast progression, and to work alongside others who share my enthusiasm.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

AT RBS, I joined a team initially consisting of only two people on a Project, and where I was considered a Project SME for Ringtail E-Discovery software. Yet I had never used this software before and did not having a technical background. However, my diligence and ability to adapt quickly allowed me to make a steep learning curve.


#### Initiative

In my previous roles and at University, I had a reputation for being motivated and self-disciplined. This skill was first honed whilst studying for my degree, where organisation and the ability to complete work independently was essential, given that I had only 4 hours of contact time with professors each week. This has helped me to take the initiative in the workplace. In my role at RBS, I recognised the need to establish a formalised process for the removal of data from our databases, which I designed and proposed to my workstream lead. This process was subsequently implemented across the Bank Project.

#### People

In my previous role I was required to explain, or 'demistify' the technology we were using  to those in decision making positions that were less technically minded. This was essential to ensure these stakeholders recognised the value in the work my team was doing.  This experience showed me the importance of open and patient communication with others, and of breaking down the barriers to understanding created by technical language.

## Interests

• Cooking: Learning about different cuisines and new cooking techniques is another way that I satisfy my thirst for knowledge. A Butchery course is currently on my hit list. I also love bringing friends and family together and making people happy through food
• Fitness: Staying active - whether I'm hiking, kayaking, gymming - keeps my mind clear and positive
• Photography: I enjoy figuring out how to old analogue cameras work and creating unusual effects, like double exposures. I once helped out in a photography gallery in Tokyo during the summer when I was a student
