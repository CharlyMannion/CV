## Charlotte Mannion

I am a full stack developer and graduate of Makers Academy looking for a Junior developer role. I'm excited for the opportunity to continue the steep learning curve that I started at Makers. I'm looking for a position in a supportive team environment with people who share my enthusiasm for clean, clear code.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

Makers Academy has accelerated my coding skills exponentially, but made me actutely aware of how much I still want and need to learn. I started Makers with next to no knowledge of coding, but have surpised myself with how far I have come in such a short space of time. A great example of this was the two week engineering project, where we built a Java/Spring clone of Facebook without ever having used Java, Spring or React before. These two weeks were pretty tough, but my team definitely ended on high and a sense of achievement. Starting from the bottom has also meant I have absorbed and become an advocate for best practices such as TDD, DRY and SOLID. 

#### Teamwork

In our first team challenge, my team had daily stand ups, check-ins and retros. These sessions ensured team cohesion, kept us focused on our objectives, and also made the week really fun. I also believe that pairing and our knowledge sharing sessions allowed us to overcome blockers with setting up the project more quickly than we would have done working separately. On reflection, I felt that the most important skill I had learned from this project was how to work well in a dev team, and I took this learning with me in to the rest of team projects.
 
#### Adaptability

This skill was essential in my previous job, when I joined a team initially consisting of only two people, on a Project where I was considered a Project SME for Ringtail E-Discovery software.  I had never used this software before and did not have a technical background. This experience required me to make a steep learning curve, but I was soon teaching other people on the project and new team members to use the software. 

#### Excellent Communicator

In my previous job I was required to explain, or 'demistify' the technology we were using  to those in decision making positions that were less technically minded. This was essential to ensure these stakeholders recognised the value in the work my team was doing.  This experience showed me the importance of open and patient communication with others, and I think it will serve me well in my future career as a software developer.
